-----FOLLOW THESE STEPS FIRST IF YOU GOT ANY ERROR GO THROUGH README.md FILE-----

1. CREATE ".env" FILE FROM ".env.example" FILE COPY ALL AND PASTE IN ".env" FILE AND CONFIGURE DATABASE CREDENTIALS
2. RUN "setup_windows.bat" FOR WINDOWS TO DIRECTLY SETUP ON WINDOWS AND FOR MAC/LINUX RUN "setup_unix.sh" 

(THESE SETUPS MEANT TO INITIALIZE DATABASE AND DATABASE CONNECTION REQUIRED FOR DATA TO STORE AND FETCH)
